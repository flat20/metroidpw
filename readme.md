# Metroid Password Tool

`GameData` contains game state information which can be manipulated before encoding it in to a Metroid password.

`Password` is the encoded Metroid password which can be output as a formatted password string.

`lua/metroid_pw_tester.lua` is a basic script for the FCEUX NES emulator which can be used to test Metroid passwords and their decoded output in the emulator.
